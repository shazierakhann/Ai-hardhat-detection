# Ai-hardhat-detection
AI-based hardhat detection system using YOLO and OpenCV with real-time camera input and Telegram alert for construction site safety.
# AI Hardhat Detection System with Telegram Alert

This project is developed as a Final Year Project for a Diploma in Electronic Technology.

## Overview
A real-time AI-based hardhat detection system using YOLO and OpenCV. The system detects workers who are not wearing safety hardhat and sends automatic Telegram alerts with images and timestamps for safety monitoring.

## Features
- Real-time helmet and no-hardhat detection
- Webcam video input
- Automatic Telegram alert with image evidence
- Cooldown system to prevent alert spam
- Visual bounding boxes (red for no hardhat, green for hardhat)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Telegram Bot API
- Computer Vision

## Use Case
Designed for construction sites and industrial environments to improve safety compliance.

## Learning Outcome
- Implementing real-time object detection
- Integrating AI with messaging APIs
- Practical use of computer vision for industrial safety
